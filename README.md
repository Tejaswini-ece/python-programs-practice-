## üìã List of Programs

### 1. Calculator (`1_calculator.py`)
A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) based on user input.

**Example:**
```
Enter operator: +
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15.0
```

### 2. Compound Interest Calculator (`2_compound_interest.py`)
Calculates the compound interest based on user-entered principal, rate, and time (in years).

**Example:**
```
Enter the principle amount: 1000
Enter the interest rate: 5
Enter the time in years: 2
Balance after 2 years: $1102.50
```

### 3. Shopping Cart (`3_shopping_cart.py`)
A program that simulates a shopping cart. Users can enter multiple food items and their prices. It shows the final bill.
